Bash Include

Modularizes bash scripts by introducing a 'include' as well as some coding guidelines and examples. 
This can be used for cleanly separate reusable functionality from the acctual implementations.

bash_include already provides some basic - essential modules

[how to install]

download gentoo/bash_include/distfiles/*.tar.bz2
configure --prefix=/what/ever && make && make install

gentoo users may use the ebuild

[how to use]

copy [/what/ever/]lib/bash_include/script-template to any directory and fill the gaps
take a look at the examples or projects that use bash-include (eg kvm-manager) 
to get a idea on what you can do

[how to develop]

make -f Makefile.default

clones the repository to a temporary directory, configures, packs the configured sources
builds them, installs them to a testing directory
